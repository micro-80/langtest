* Langtest

Shockingly I have never made a programming language, nor have I ever programmed anything in C. This is an attmept to fix both at once.

I'm making best effort attempts to do things correctly, but I also just want things to work so there will some quite sloppy code.

I haven't read any tutorials or followed any guides about either C or tokeniser design - I'm just trying things out.
